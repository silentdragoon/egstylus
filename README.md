# egstylus

This is a set of two styles for the EG CMS. One is a dark mode that changes the colour scheme of the article writing/editing screen, while the other includes the same dark colour scheme but also includes layout and font changes. Everything is written in CSS and can be tweaked to your liking (eg you can write in the name of a font of your choice, change the font size and so on). The styles are applied using Stylus, an extension supported by most modern browsers.

## Tutorial

* Install Stylus for [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne), [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/styl-us/) or [Opera](https://addons.opera.com/extensions/details/stylus/). 
* Open and save [this .json file to your desktop](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/silentdragoon/egstylus/main/egcms-styles.json)
* Open Stylus by clicking on the S icon in the top right of your toolbar or extensions list
* Click **Manage** and a screen will appear
* Under the **Backup** section on the left select Import
* Select the .json file you downloaded earlier
* It should say "Finished importing styles" and "2 added"
* Tick your preferred style to enable it, or untick it to disable it. As well as doing this on the **Manage** screen, you can also do this on the EG CMS itself by clicking the Stylus icon (in the upper right of the screen or in the extensions list for Chrome users).
